# Code Challenge 7
## Reacting Quickly

1. Created repo for capstone project
2. Cloned repo to my home directory
3. Opened iTerm, ran command ( npx create-react-app <name of project/app>) in my case code-challenge-7
4. After running command, I also ran cd (name of project) code-challenge-7, then yarn start

## I decided to go to refactor the Spotify Challenge
